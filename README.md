##  :scroll:  Project Description

This project aims to create a deep learning model to predict if a customer would continue to deposit money to expand a bank's revenue.
For this objective, the bank carried out a campaign to collect customers' details as well as their needs and satisfactions.
The data collected can be retrieved in the train.csv file in the repo.

A sneak peek of the model developed is the figure below:
